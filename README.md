### GRS_model
#### This program is a MATLAB R2023a program aimed at simulating the sensing process of GRS (Gravity Reference Sensor) in low orbit. The TM translational and rotational motion and dynamics models built include two types:. m file and Simulink program. The former runs slowly, while the latter runs faster.
#### GRS_Model_Main.m is the main program, including GRS parameter settings and related fault settings. GRS_ Model.slx and GRS_Model_Fault.slx are the Simulink programs, and all other files are subfunctions.
